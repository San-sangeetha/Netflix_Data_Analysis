# Netflix_Data_Analysis
--I conducted a data analysis on Netflix data using Python and a popular data manipulation library called Pandas.

-- As part of this analysis, I discovered that there were two duplicate records in the dataset which I removed to ensure accurate results. I also found that there were some null values present, which I highlighted using a heatmap visualization.

-- One of the questions I explored was about the popular show "Friends". I was able to find its unique show_id and the director of the show.

-- I also looked at the distribution of TV shows and movies released over the years and found that the highest number of releases occurred in 2019, with a total of 2153.

-- Further, I visualized the breakdown of the types of content in the dataset, revealing that there were 5377 movies and 2410 TV shows.

-- I also investigated how many movies were made in the year 2020 and found that there were 1312 such titles.

-- Additionally, I looked at the number of titles released in India only and found that it was 923.

-- Furthermore, I explored the top 10 directors who had directed the highest number of movies or web series.

-- I filtered the dataset to show only those records where the category was "movie" and the type was "comedy" or the country was "India". I also identified the different ratings provided by Netflix.

*This is just a sample of the many interesting insights and questions I was able to explore during my data analysis of Netflix data.
